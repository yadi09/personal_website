      I took this photo in the capital of my country (Addis Abeba). 
      Me and the girl are new to Addis Abeba city. 
      To bring my photography passion to my desired goal And the city i was in was not suitable for this, 
      So I came to addis abeba and when i went out to take my first street photo, 
      I met this sad and amazing girl. She is an immigrant like me but the difference is that i came here of my own free will, 
      but she was forced to come here because of the ethnic conflict in our country, 
      innocent blood is shed, Their houses are burned, 
      so they are forced to emigrate and this girl is also a part of this suffering her house is burnt, 
      she doesn't know if her family will live or die, even though all this happened to her, we can see HOPE and STRENGTH in her face. 
      But I am not talking about only one girl, many sad children are in this situation let's look at ourselves, 
      Do we have despair or strength for our problems? *your smile is not indicate your Convenience
